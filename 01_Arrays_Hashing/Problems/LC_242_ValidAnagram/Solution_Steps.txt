LC_242_ValidAnagram - Solution Steps

Problem: Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

=== APPROACH 1: Character Count Array (Optimal) ===

Intuition: 
If two strings are anagrams, they must have the same character frequencies. Use an array to count characters and increment for string s, decrement for string t.

Step 1: Check if lengths are different, return false if so
Step 2: Create an integer array of size 26 (for lowercase letters a-z)
Step 3: Iterate through both strings simultaneously
Step 4: For each character in string s, increment count[char - 'a']
Step 5: For each character in string t, decrement count[char - 'a']
Step 6: After processing, check if all counts are zero
Step 7: If all counts are zero, strings are anagrams (return true)
Step 8: If any count is non-zero, not anagrams (return false)

Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through strings
Space Complexity: O(1) - fixed size array of 26 elements

=== APPROACH 2: Sorting ===

Intuition:
If two strings are anagrams, they will be identical when sorted.

Step 1: Check if lengths are different, return false if so
Step 2: Convert both strings to character arrays
Step 3: Sort both character arrays
Step 4: Compare sorted arrays for equality
Step 5: Return true if equal, false otherwise

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - due to sorting
Space Complexity: O(n) - for character arrays

=== APPROACH 3: HashMap ===

Intuition:
Count character frequencies for both strings using HashMap and compare the frequency maps.

Step 1: Check if lengths are different, return false if so
Step 2: Create two HashMaps to count characters in each string
Step 3: Iterate through first string, count character frequencies
Step 4: Iterate through second string, count character frequencies
Step 5: Compare the two HashMaps for equality
Step 6: Return true if maps are equal, false otherwise

Time Complexity: O(n) - linear pass through strings
Space Complexity: O(k) - where k is number of unique characters

=== APPROACH 4: Single HashMap (Alternative) ===

Intuition:
Use one HashMap, increment for string s characters, decrement for string t characters.

Step 1: Check if lengths are different, return false if so
Step 2: Create one HashMap
Step 3: Iterate through string s, increment character counts
Step 4: Iterate through string t, decrement character counts
Step 5: Check if all values in HashMap are zero
Step 6: Return true if all zero, false otherwise

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(k)

Interview Tip: Character count array is optimal for lowercase letters. Mention HashMap approach for Unicode characters.
